It is a bright and cheerful day, as our hero Gabe the Onion Merchant sets out to give a present to his childhood friend, hoping that his feelings will reach her. Gabe’s trading skills are second to none and as such, he has managed to stock up tons of onions. A resourceful chap as well as a true romantic, he decided to put his odd fortune to use and spent months meticulously creating a sculpture out of pure onion. “With this, she will surely realize that my love for her has layers!” With such a display of wit and the beauty of onions, this should be the perfect gift.
pic5
After building up the courage, Gabe walks up to the love of his life and hands her a gift that he had been working on for 3 straight months. As he is approaching her, something feels off, almost like he forgot a hugely important detail, but he can’t quite figure out what it is. He disregards the thought, and decides to go through with his plan.
pic13
Later that day, Gabe returns to the park where he gave the gift to the girl, only to find his meticulous artwork was left on the ground and completely destroyed. He remembers what he had forgotten earlier - the girl is allergic to onions. He is upset with himself for forgetting this detail, but more upset that the girl had destroyed his craft and rejected him.
pic6
Heartbroken from the stinging rejection, Gabe is overwhelmed by sadness and anger, and he starts plotting his revenge.
pic9
“I was foolish. For what did I amass these onions in the first place.... but God strike me down this instant if I won’t have my revenge. Prepare for onionage in its most brutal form.” Unsure of an exact plan, he stockpiles months worth of onions in his shed in preparation for whatever revenge idea he comes up with. Little did he know, these would be no ordinary onions...
pic15
In his sleep, Gabe is visited by the Corgi King who inspires him to utilize magical Corgi powers to pursue his revenge on the girl.
pic10
After chatting with the Corgi King, Gabe strikes a deal: he can utilize any of the Corgi King’s powers only if he gets a rent-free stay at Gabe’s place. Both parties were very pleased with the deal, and the Corgi King revealed to Gabe one of his powers. He can make any person hear the sound of a thousand newborn babies crying whenever they set their eyes on him. However, an additional sacrifice is required, due to the law of equivalent exchange...

“My precious onions, who have made so many merchants cry, you have served me well. Now it is time to cry yourself. Serve me as eternal crying babies.”
